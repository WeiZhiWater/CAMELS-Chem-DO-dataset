# CAMELS-Chem DO dataset
The CAMELS-Chem dataset is developed by the Nevada Mountain Ecohydrology Lab (https://naes.unr.edu/harpold/) led by Adrian A. Harpold (@NV_Mtn_Ecohydro) at University of Neveda, Reno. It builds a stream chemistry database that supplements to the Catchment Attribute for Large Sample Studies (CAMESLS) database (Addor et al., 2017; Newman et al., 2015).

The newly developed dataset, CAMELS-Chem, compiles USGS water chemistry and instantaneous discharge from 1980 through 2014 in 493 headwater catchments. It includes common stream water chemistry related constituents (pH, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Cl, NO3, SO4, Si, HCO3, organic nitrogen, total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, total organic carbon, and etc), as well as an overlapping set of annual wet deposition load from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (Br, Ca, Cl, H, K, Mg, N, Na, NH4, NO3, SO4). 

***This page includes the DO records from the CAMELS-Chem database used in Zhi et al., (2021). The entire database will be available when the CAMELS-Chem manuscript is published (Sterle et al., in preparation).***
